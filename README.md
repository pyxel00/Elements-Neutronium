# ExpandedWarfare

Expanded Warfare is a rimworld mod project that is still under construction and probably will be under construction for a long time.

Expanded Warfare adds new weapons, equipment, grenades and weapons of mass destruction. I am now sure about the weapons of mass destruction but still.

In this stage the mod includes a variety of weapons that are mostly stupid but funny. Example : Glass grenade.

This mod requires Vanilla Expanded Framework to work becasue expanded warfare includes new gas types and i couldn't find any documentation or anything about the new gas system added in 1.4 update of rimworld.
