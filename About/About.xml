    Elements  : Neutronium is the first mod of the new series : Elements. This mod series focuses on new elements. Coming from fantasies, theories and other various ideas. In the Elements : Neutronium mod focuses on a theoretical element called neutronium. Which is an element thought to be existing inside the neutron stars.
    
Elements : Neutronium adds 

- 4 New weapons which use neutronium as bullets.
- 1 New neutronium shell which is quite powerful and is a clean nuke.
- 1 New rocket launcher which is like neutronium shell.
- A new reactor using neutronium as fuel.
- And a way to produce neutronium from steel.

it doesn't add much I know but since it is my first mod I didin't want to go overboard and set the expectations too high since I am a new modder which only started a week ago. But as I move on new mods will be available(Maybe I can quit.) adding much more stuff and maybe some new mechanics
