Elements : Neutronium is the first mod of the new series Elements. This mod series focus on adding new elements to the rim. some are coming from fantasies, some are theoretical elements from real life. As for neutronim it is a theoretical substance thought to exist inside the neutron stars.

This mod adds :

-1 New material called neutronium.

-4 New neutronium weapons which use neutronium as bullets.

-1 New shell which uses neutronium as an explosive and is pretty powerful.

-1 New rocket launcher firing neutronium rockets.

-A new reactor using neutronium as fuel.

-And a way to produce neutronium

-- Neutronium --

An element consisting of neutrons. Theorized to exist inside neutron stars. Neutronium is very powerful. Neutrons have a half-life on 611 seconds and release around 1MeV(Million electron Volts) in their half-life. Neutrons have an absurd amount of power and they are quite dense. 1 Kilogram(2.2 lbs) produces as much energy as 2.000.000(2 Million) tsar bombas. The most powerful nuke ever detonated in the history. In just one second.

-- Neutron weapons --

As I said before there is 4 of them which are : Neutron assault rifle, Neutron SMG, Neutron 47 and Neutron shotgun. All of these weapons fire neutronium as bullets. More info about them is in the mod.

-- Neutronium Shell --

Clean nuke.

-- Neutronium rocket launcher --

Shell but in hand but smaller.

-- Neutronium Reactor -- 

A reactor using the absurd power of neutrons to produce power. It is very efficient but also deadly if explodes. Puts 10000W to the grid.

-- Centrifuge --

An advanced centrifuge which is spinning at billions of times per second. With this rotation power it is able to overcome strong nuclear force. Using the slight difference between neutrons and protons it can seperate the two.

Is this CE compatible?
  
I have no idea how to make something compatible with CE so for now it is not.

Why isn't this on steam?
  
I don't own the game on the steam and because of the steamworkshop thing I cannot publish it in steam.
